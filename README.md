# geometric_stack_height

This code is written in Java and it appears to be trying to solve a geometric problem.

A linked list of integers representing the lengths of some segments is given as input. The code calculates the maximum height of a stack of these segments so that each segment is supported by two other segments on its ends, and the height of the stack is minimized.
The code prints the maximum height and closes the scanner.
